I will add other VMs once I gat my information off of them. They already have windows and spice 
guest tools installed so you shouldn't have to mess with that. 

These work with both Intel and Apple Silicon macs (I made them on my Intel macbook and tested 
them on my M1 mac mini and it worked for both)

To open the VM, unzip the file and click on the .utm file. These will only work with the latest
version of UTM

All of this was come by legally, used web archives do get disk images of older OS's, and downloaded
newer ones off of official websites.

Enjoy!
